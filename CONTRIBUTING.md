## üöÄ Getting Started

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BHTikTok++! This document outlines our development practices, git workflow, and contribution guidelines to ensure high-quality collaborative development.

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** with **full Xcode** installed (not just Command Line Tools)
- **Theos** development framework (installed via official script)
- **Git** with proper SSH key configuration
- **Jailbroken iOS device** or **iOS Simulator** for testing
- Understanding of **Objective-C** and **Logos syntax**

### Quick Start

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a feature branch
5. Make your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

```bash
# Install full Xcode from App Store (required - Command Line Tools alone are insufficient)
# After installation, accept the license:
sudo xcodebuild -license accept

# Verify Xcode installation
xcode-select --print-path
```

### 2. Theos Installation

```bash
# Install Theos using the official installation script
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theos/theos/master/bin/install-theos)"

# The script will automatically:
# - Install Theos to /opt/theos
# - Set up environment variables
# - Configure your shell profile

# Verify installation
echo $THEOS
# Should output: /opt/theos

# Restart your terminal or source your shell profile
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bash_profile for bash users
```

### 3. Project Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/BHTikTokPlusPlusPlus.git
cd BHTikTokPlusPlusPlus

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ORIGINAL_OWNER/BHTikTokPlusPlusPlus.git

# Install dependencies and build
make clean && make
```

### 4. Device Configuration

```bash
# Configure your test device
export THEOS_DEVICE_IP=YOUR_DEVICE_IP
export THEOS_DEVICE_USER=root

# Test connection
ssh root@$THEOS_DEVICE_IP "echo 'Connection successful'"
```

## üîÑ Git Workflow and Branching Strategy

We use a **GitFlow-inspired** branching strategy with four main branches and feature branches for isolated development.

### Branch Structure

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch dev
    commit id: "Dev Setup"
    branch staging
    commit id: "Staging Setup"
    checkout main
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    checkout dev
    branch feature/new-download-system
    commit id: "Feature Work"
    commit id: "Feature Complete"
    checkout dev
    merge feature/new-download-system
    commit id: "Integrate Feature"
    checkout staging
    merge dev
    commit id: "Staging Test"
    checkout main
    merge staging
    commit id: "v1.1.0"
```

### Main Branches

#### 1. `main` Branch
- **Purpose**: Stable production releases
- **Protection**: Protected branch, no direct commits
- **Merge Source**: Only from `staging` branch
- **Triggers**: Release builds and distribution packages
- **Version**: Always tagged with semantic versioning

#### 2. `dev` Branch  
- **Purpose**: Active development and integration
- **Protection**: Semi-protected, requires PR approval
- **Merge Source**: Feature branches and hotfixes
- **Testing**: Continuous integration and automated testing
- **Stability**: Should always be buildable

#### 3. `staging` Branch
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Protection**: Protected branch, requires comprehensive testing
- **Merge Source**: Only from `dev` branch
- **Testing**: Full QA testing, compatibility validation
- **Approval**: Requires maintainer approval for `main` merge

#### 4. Feature Branches
- **Naming**: `feature/description` or `feature/issue-number`
- **Source**: Always branch from `dev`
- **Scope**: Single feature or related changes
- **Lifetime**: Short-lived, deleted after merge

### Workflow Process

#### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Start from latest dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull upstream dev

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/advanced-download-queue

# Work on your feature
# ... make changes ...

# Commit with conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(download): add download queue management system

- Implement priority-based download queue
- Add pause/resume functionality for downloads
- Include batch download progress tracking
- Add download speed throttling options

Closes #123"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/advanced-download-queue
```

#### 2. Pull Request Creation

```bash

```

#### 3. Integration to Staging

```bash
# After feature PR is merged to dev
git checkout staging
git pull upstream staging

# Merge dev into staging
git merge upstream/dev
git push upstream staging

# Trigger staging deployment and testing
```

#### 4. Production Release

```bash
# After staging validation
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Merge staging into main
git merge upstream/staging

## üëÄ Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors

- **Small PRs**: Keep changes focused and reviewable

- [ ] **Performance**: No obvious performance issues?
- [ ] **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is code self-documenting or well-commented?

#### 2. Feedback Guidelines

```markdown
<!-- Good feedback -->
**Suggestion**: Consider using a constant for this magic number to improve maintainability.

```objective-c
// Instead of
if (downloadCount > 50) {

// Consider
static const NSInteger kMaxDownloadCount = 50;
if (downloadCount > kMaxDownloadCount) {
```

**Question**: What happens if this URL is nil? Should we add a guard clause?

**Praise**: Great use of defensive programming here!
```

#### 3. Review Priorities

1. **Correctness**: Does it work as intended?
2. **Security**: Are there any security implications?
3. **Performance**: Will this impact app performance?
4. **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and maintainable?
5. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?

## üöÄ Release Management

    return NO;
}
%end
```
