# Documentation Audit Report

This report details the discrepancies found between the technical documentation and the source code.
### BHDownload

*   **Missing Documentation File:** The link in `docs/README.md` to `[Single File Downloads](download/bh-download.md)` is broken. The file `docs/download/bh-download.md` needs to be created.
*   **Undocumented Delegate:** The `BHDownloadDelegate` protocol and its methods are not documented. This includes:
    *   `downloadProgress:`
    *   `downloadDidFinish:Filename:`
    *   `downloadDidFailureWithError:`
*   **Undocumented Methods:** The following methods in the `BHDownload` class are not documented:
    *   `setDelegate:`
    *   `init`
    *   `downloadFileWithURL:`
*   **Undocumented Property:** The `fileName` property is not documented.
*   **Inaccurate Mermaid Diagram:** The diagram in `docs/README.md` inaccurately shows a dependency from `BHDownload` to `JGProgressHUD`. This link should be removed from the diagram.
### BHMultipleDownload

*   **Missing Documentation File:** The link in `docs/README.md` to `[Multiple File Downloads](download/bh-multiple-download.md)` is broken. The file `docs/download/bh-multiple-download.md` needs to be created.
*   **Undocumented Delegate:** The `BHMultipleDownloadDelegate` protocol and its methods are not documented. This includes:
    *   `downloaderProgress:`
    *   `downloaderDidFinishDownloadingAllFiles:`
    *   `downloaderDidFailureWithError:`
*   **Undocumented Method:** The `downloadFiles:` method is not documented.
*   **Undocumented Properties:** The `session` and `delegate` properties are not documented.
*   **Inaccurate Mermaid Diagram:** The diagram in `docs/README.md` inaccurately shows a dependency from `BHMultipleDownload` to `JGProgressHUD`. This link should be removed from the diagram.
### BHIManager

*   **Missing Documentation File:** The link in `docs/README.md` to `[Manager System](core/bhi-manager.md)` is broken. The file `docs/core/bhi-manager.md` needs to be created.
*   **Undocumented Methods:** All 43 methods in the `BHIManager` class are undocumented. A complete documentation of all methods is required.
*   **Incomplete Mermaid Diagram:** The diagram in `docs/README.md` does not fully represent the dependencies of `BHIManager`. The diagram should be updated to show the relationships with other components of the application.
